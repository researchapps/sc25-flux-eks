## Working with Markdown Files

### Opening Files
1. Click on any `.md` file in the file explorer
2. The file opens in source view by default
3. Use preview mode for better readability (see below)

### Markdown Preview Mode
**Essential for this workshop!** Preview mode renders markdown with proper formatting, images, and clickable links.

**Ways to open preview:**
- `Ctrl+Shift+V` - Open preview in current tab
- `Ctrl+K V` - Open preview side-by-side with source
- Right-click file → "Open Preview"

### Navigation Between Files
- **Click links**: In preview mode, click any link to navigate
- **Breadcrumbs**: Use the breadcrumb navigation at the top of each file
- **File explorer**: Browse the folder structure
- **Quick open**: Press `Ctrl+P` and type filename

## Essential VS Code Shortcuts

### File Navigation
- `Ctrl+P` - Quick open file by name
- `Ctrl+Shift+E` - Focus file explorer
- `Ctrl+Tab` - Switch between open files
- `Ctrl+W` - Close current file

### Markdown Specific
- `Ctrl+Shift+V` - Toggle markdown preview
- `Ctrl+K V` - Open preview to the side
- `Ctrl+Shift+F` - Search across all files

### Terminal
- `Ctrl+`` - Toggle terminal panel
- `Ctrl+Shift+`` - Create new terminal
- `Ctrl+C` - Stop running command

### General
- `Ctrl++` / `Ctrl+-` - Zoom in/out
- `Ctrl+,` - Open settings
- `F11` - Toggle fullscreen

## Workshop Navigation Strategy

### Recommended Workflow
1. **Start with overview**: Always read the module README first
2. **Follow the sequence**: Use numbered files (01-, 02-, etc.) in order
3. **Use breadcrumbs**: Navigate up/down the hierarchy as needed
4. **Keep terminal ready**: Have the integrated terminal open for commands

### Following Links
- **Internal links**: Click to navigate between workshop sections
- **External links**: Open in new browser tab (Ctrl+click)
- **Command blocks**: Copy commands to the terminal

### Managing Multiple Files
- **Side-by-side**: Open instructions in preview, keep terminal visible
- **Multiple tabs**: Keep related files open in tabs
- **Split editor**: Use `Ctrl+\` to split the editor for multiple views

## Tips for Success

### Reading Workshop Content
> **💡 Tip:** Always use markdown preview mode for workshop materials. The formatting, images, and navigation work much better in preview.

### Running Commands
> **💡 Tip:** Copy commands from the preview mode and paste them into the integrated terminal. This ensures accuracy and saves time.

### Staying Organized
> **💡 Tip:** Follow the numbered sequence in each module. The content builds progressively, and skipping sections may cause issues.

### Getting Help
> **💡 Tip:** If you get lost, return to the main [workshop README](../README.md) or the current module's README for orientation.

## Troubleshooting

### Preview Not Working
- Ensure you're viewing a `.md` file
- Try `Ctrl+Shift+V` to toggle preview
- Check that the file isn't corrupted

### Links Not Clickable
- Make sure you're in preview mode, not source view
- Links only work in markdown preview

### Can't Find Files
- Use `Ctrl+P` and start typing the filename
- Check the file explorer for the correct folder structure
- Ensure you're in the `workshop-assets` directory

### Terminal Issues
- Press `Ctrl+`` to toggle terminal visibility
- Create a new terminal with `Ctrl+Shift+``
- Make sure you're in the correct directory (`pwd` to check)

## Ready to Start!

Now that you understand how to navigate the workshop materials, you're ready to begin the technical content. 

**Next step**: Head to [Module 1: HPC on Kubernetes](../02-module1-hpc-kubernetes/README.md) to start the hands-on workshop.
